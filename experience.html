<center><p style="background-color:#F6E3BA;">Alhamdulillah, i got the opportunity to enjoy the natural beauty of His creation.
This time I'll share my experience the day climbing Mount Baling.
For your information, Gunung Baling is located in the Baling district of Kedah
and is 546 meters above sea level. In addition, this mountain is adjacent to 
Mount Pulai which is probably about 500 meters away. According to my experience,
the time needed to get on top was around 1 hour 15 minutes is required. However, 
if you have high stamina you may be able to reach the top faster.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p style="background-color:#E8DCB5;">According to the information I have obtained, most climbers who climb Mount
Baling are to see the ‘carpet clouds’. However, these clouds are not always present.
Only the lucky ones might be able to see this cloud.Alhamdulillah, i'm the lucky one 
and got to see the clouds. In this case, the best time for you to climb is in the early
morning and make sure you reach the summit before sunrise.This is because, after the sun
starts to rise the ‘carpet clouds’ will gradually disappear.In addition, 'carpet clouds' 
will be more visible if it rains at night.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p style="background-color:#F6E3BA;">For your information, the climbing track to the top of Mount Baling is easier
compared to Mount Pulai. This is because, more than 80 percent of its tracks are dim.
However, since the track is muddy, the surface of the track is quite slippery especially
when going down the mountain. In this case, you need to wisely arrange the steps so as
not to slide down or get injured.</p.</center>
